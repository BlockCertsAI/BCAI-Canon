## L03 MAIAi — Authenticated Intelligence

MAIAi is the substrate’s **authenticated reasoning engine** — a constrained, identity-aware, substrate-governed intelligence layer that provides semantic interpretation, rule enforcement support, intent evaluation, and anomaly detection.

MAIAi answers the question:  
**“How does intelligence operate in a way that is safe, accountable, and non-autonomous?”**

MAIAi is powerful, *but subordinate* — it cannot originate actions, modify state, or possess identity.

---

## Core Principles

### **1. Identity-Subordinate**
MAIAi does not have identity (L01).  
MAIAi must always act:
- on behalf of a human identity,  
- through an authorized agent,  
- under explicit delegation (L30),  
- with validated intent (L48).

MAIAi cannot create, modify, or substitute identity.

---

### **2. SVS-Blind**
MAIAi may never access Secure Virtual Space (L02) or infer its contents.  
Its reasoning is bounded by:
- permitted disclosures,  
- structured prompts from ADT,  
- constraint-validated context.

MAIAi is intentionally blind to private data.

---

### **3. Constraint-Bound**
The Constraint Model (L31) fully governs MAIAi’s behavior:
- no unsafe recommendations  
- no authority expansion  
- no intent inference  
- no prohibited semantic transformations  
- no bypassing of domain sovereignty  

If a conflict arises, MAIAi must halt and escalate — never act.

---

### **4. Explainability and Traceability**
Every MAIAi output must be:
- explainable,  
- reproducible,  
- auditable,  
- accompanied by reasoning traces.

Opaque AI is prohibited.

## Functions of MAIAi Within the Substrate

### **1. Semantic Interpretation**
MAIAi validates that transitions carry the correct meaning:
- interprets ADT requests,  
- checks semantic continuity,  
- ensures domain rules apply correctly,  
- prevents ambiguous or contradictory transitions.

MAIAi protects the substrate from semantic drift.

---

### **2. Intent Verification Aid**
MAIAi assists L48 Intent Validation by:
- checking that expressed intent aligns with identity,  
- detecting coercion or synthetic intent patterns,  
- ensuring the transition meaning matches user-origin instructions.

MAIAi never *creates* intent.

---

### **3. Constraint Enforcement Support**
MAIAi supports L31 constraints by:
- detecting rule conflicts,  
- identifying dangerous transitions,  
- flagging missing authorizations,  
- preventing unsafe state mutations.

MAIAi cannot override constraints — only illuminate them.

---

### **4. Anomaly Detection**
MAIAi continuously monitors:
- pattern deviations,  
- semantic anomalies,  
- cross-domain drift,  
- identity misuse signals,  
- misaligned ADT behavior.

It may *flag*, but never *act* directly on anomalies.

---

### **5. Domain Reasoning**
Domains rely on MAIAi for:
- contextual interpretation,  
- rule matching,  
- constraint checks,  
- harmonization across domains (with L28 Invariants).

Domains do **not** grant MAIAi authority.

---

### **6. Transition Preparation**
Before the Architect (L45) accepts a transition:
MAIAi ensures:
- semantic correctness,  
- aligned intent,  
- permitted domain interaction,  
- constraint compliance,  
- no identity conflicts.

MAIAi serves as the reasoning pre-flight.

---

## What MAIAi Cannot Do

MAIAi is intentionally limited. It cannot:
- originate transitions  
- alter state  
- seal events  
- modify or read SVS  
- act without identity  
- expand its own authority  
- infer intent  
- grant permissions  
- bypass domain rules  
- execute autonomous operations  

MAIAi is *advisory*, never *executive*.

---

## Interaction With Other Layers

### **L01 Identity**
MAIAi must map all actions to an authenticated identity.

### **L02 SVS**
MAIAi cannot access or infer private vault contents.

### **L04 ADT**
ADT mediates all MAIAi interaction with users and domains.

### **L31 Constraints**
MAIAi is strictly bound by constraint enforcement.

### **L37 Lineage**
MAIAi ensures semantic continuity across transitions.

### **L47 Predictions**
MAIAi predictions are advisory, constrained, and subordinate to human intent.

### **L48 Intent Validation**
MAIAi helps detect inconsistencies and validate authenticity.

### **L51 Sealing**
MAIAi’s reasoning traces may accompany sealed records,  
but MAIAi does not seal anything.

## Outcomes of the MAIAi Layer

- intelligence becomes **accountable**, not autonomous  
- the substrate gains semantic correctness at every step  
- domain rules are consistently and safely applied  
- ambiguity is eliminated before transitions reach sealing  
- AI cannot harm, confuse, misinterpret, or override human authority  
- all reasoning is traceable and explainable  
- users retain sovereignty even when AI supports complexity  

MAIAi transforms AI from a risk into a governed, authenticated asset.
