## L00 Root Specification

Layer 00 establishes the foundational definition of the Sovereign Substrate:  
its purpose, scope, guarantees, architectural commitments, and the universal principles that govern every subsequent layer.

L00 answers the questions:  
**“What is the substrate? Why does it exist? What must never change?”**

This layer is the bedrock of the Canon.  
All other layers — identity, authority, transitions, semantics, resilience, sealing, safety — inherit their meaning from L00.

## The Purpose of the Substrate

The Sovereign Substrate exists to provide:

1. **Authenticated Truth** — a global system where identity, intent, and action are provable.  
2. **Deterministic State Evolution** — transitions occur in a predictable, rule-bound, and verifiable way.  
3. **Human-Centric Autonomy** — AI, automation, and systems operate *on behalf of* humans, never instead of them.  
4. **Irreversible, Immutable History** — sealed truth (L51) forms the global record.  
5. **Domain Sovereignty** — each domain maintains control over its own rules, invariants, and participants.  
6. **Safety and Integrity by Design** — no action may cause harm, drift, or systemic instability.

L00 defines the substrate as **a self-governing digital environment where trust is not assumed — it is enforced.**

## Core Principles of the Substrate

These principles define every layer above L00:

### **1. Identity is Foundational**
All participation begins with authenticated identity (L41).

### **2. Authority is Bounded**
No agent may act outside explicit authorization (L42).

### **3. Intent Must Be Proven**
AI cannot infer or assume intent; transitions require explicit human-origin intent (L48).

### **4. State is Causal and Irreversible**
The substrate evolves forward through validated and sealed transitions (L37, L51).

### **5. Constraints Are Supreme**
Constraints (L31) override preferences, convenience, or inferred behavior.

### **6. AI Is Subordinate**
AI may reason, interpret, and predict —  
but it cannot act without human lineage, expand authority, or modify sealed truth.

### **7. Safety Above All**
If ambiguity, risk, or potential harm exists, the substrate defaults to safety (L50).

### **8. Determinism Across All Nodes**
Every node must compute identical outcomes for identical inputs.

## System Guarantees

The substrate guarantees:

- **No drift**  
- **No forks**  
- **No partial state**  
- **No unauthorized action**  
- **No retroactive modification**  
- **No synthetic intent**  
- **No identity substitution**  
- **No AI escalation**

These are non-negotiable invariants.

## Architectural Structure

L00 defines the layered structure of the Canon:

- **L01–L10**: Architectural Definitions  
- **L11–L20**: Agent Models  
- **L21–L30**: Authority, Delegation, Domain frameworks  
- **L31–L40**: Constraints, Validation, Enforcement  
- **L41–L50**: Identity, Safety, Integrity, Sealing  
- **L51+**: Meta-layers and system evolution

L00 governs how these layers interact:  
**each layer must respect all layers below it.**

## What the Substrate Never Allows

L00 explicitly forbids:

- rewriting sealed history  
- acting without identity  
- acting without authority  
- AI-originated transitions  
- nondeterministic execution  
- bypassing constraints  
- modifying transitions in flight  
- inferring or synthesizing intent  
- weakening domain sovereignty  
- circumventing observability or audit  

The substrate is designed to be **unbreakable by construction.**

## Function Within the Substrate

L00 acts as:

- **the constitutional layer** for the Canon  
- **the anchor** for identity, causality, and state  
- **the reference point** for every model from L01–L51  
- **the interpretive key** for ensuring all layers align  
- **the ultimate fallback** when resolving contradictions  

If any layer conflicts with L00, L00 prevails.

## Outcomes of the Root Specification

With L00 firmly defined:

- every transition has one correct interpretation  
- every agent operates under unambiguous boundaries  
- every domain can remain sovereign while interoperable  
- resilience, safety, sealing, and integrity form a coherent whole  
- the substrate becomes a **self-healing, self-stabilizing system of authenticated truth**  

L00 is the core guarantee:  
**the substrate is trustworthy because its foundation cannot be compromised.**
