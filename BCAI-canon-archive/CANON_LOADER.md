### Sovereign Substrate Canon Loader  
**Authoritative Entry Point → Master Index → Navigation → Canonical Layers**

The **Canon Loader** is the root execution document for the BlockCertsAI Sovereign Substrate Canon.  
It defines how humans, machines, and AI systems MUST load, interpret, traverse, and validate the Canon.

This file is not a narrative.  
This file is the **machine + human boot sequence** for understanding the Canon.

# 1. Loader Purpose
The Canon Loader provides:

1. **The unified entrypoint** for the entire Canon.  
2. **The loading order** for all Canon layers.  
3. **Cross-reference rules** for deterministic interpretation.  
4. **How AI systems MUST ingest the Canon** to avoid confabulation.  
5. **Integrity constraints** ensuring Canon correctness.  
6. **Link mappings** that bind the Root, Master Index, NAV, and all layer files.  

This defines **how the Canon is understood**, not *what the Canon says.*  
The Canon content lives in `/canon/`.  
The Loader defines *how to load it properly.*
