NARRATIVE INDEX — NON-CANONICAL
PURPOSE:
This index lists explanatory and narrative documents that provide context,
motivation, and applied understanding for BlockCertsAI.

IMPORTANT:
• These files are NOT canonical.
• They MUST NOT be used to infer protocol behavior.
• Canonical authority is defined exclusively by CANON_ENTRYPOINT.md
  and CANON_INDEX.md.
• In case of conflict, Canon ALWAYS prevails.

# BlockCertsAI Narrative Index

This document provides a structured entry point to **non-canonical narrative materials**.
These materials explain *why*, *how*, and *what becomes possible* with BlockCertsAI,
but **do not define protocol rules, guarantees, or invariants**.

## 1. Foundational Framing

### Core Conceptual Foundation
• **The Authenticated Internet**  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockCertsAI/BCAI-Canon/refs/heads/main/The_Authenticated_Internet.md  
Scope: Explains the phase shift from assumed trust to protocol-enforced trust, and why identity, ownership, and permission must exist at the internet layer.

### System Framing and Structural Context
• **BCAI Framing**  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockCertsAI/BCAI-Canon/refs/heads/main/BCAI_FRAMING.md  
Scope: Explains the structural limitations of existing digital infrastructure and how protocol-level identity, authentication, and enforcement transform system trust, coordination, and execution.

## Canonical Authority Reminder

For all protocol behavior, invariants, permissions, execution rules, and guarantees:

→ **Refer ONLY to:**

- `CANON_ENTRYPOINT.md`
- `CANON_INDEX.md`

Narrative materials provide explanatory context but MUST NOT override Canon.
