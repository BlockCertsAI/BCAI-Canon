## L10 — Sovereign Substrate Root Canon  
### (Unified Execution Law)

The Sovereign Substrate Root Canon defines the **Unified Execution Law**:  
the non-negotiable, substrate-wide rules that govern how all computation, transitions, validation, semantics, and state change MUST occur.

L10 answers the question:  
**“What laws govern execution across the entire substrate — above domains, agents, AI, and all other layers?”**

L10 is the constitutional rulebook of the substrate.  
If any layer conflicts with L10, **L10 prevails.**

---

## 1. Purpose of the Unified Execution Law

The Unified Execution Law ensures:

- deterministic computation  
- authenticated participation  
- constraint-first behavior  
- semantic coherence  
- causal ordering  
- safety dominance  
- irreversible and transparent history  
- universal consistency across nodes and domains  

L10 makes the substrate **governable, predictable, and incorruptible**.

---

## 2. Core Tenets of the Root Execution Canon

### **2.1 Identity Is Mandatory for Execution**
No operation may execute without:
- genesis identity (L01)  
- ADT mediation (L06)  
- validated intent (L48)  

Anonymous, implicit, or background execution is prohibited.

---

### **2.2 Rules Override All Agents**
All execution MUST obey:
- constraints (L31)  
- invariants (L28)  
- domain rules  
- safety model (L50)  
- identity and authority law (L21–L22)  

Nothing — not ADT, not domain logic, not MAIAi — may override these rules.

---

### **2.3 Execution Is Deterministic**
Given identical conditions, all nodes MUST reach identical results:
- identical state mutation  
- identical lineage position  
- identical sealing outcome  
- identical error classification  

Execution MUST be globally reproducible.

---

### **2.4 Substrate Truth Is Forward-Only**
Execution MUST NOT:
- mutate sealed history  
- roll back state  
- reinterpret prior semantics  
- rewrite lineage  

Truth advances only forward.

---

### **2.5 Execution Requires Complete Proof**
Every executable transition MUST carry:
- identity proof  
- authority proof  
- delegation context  
- semantic binding  
- constraint compliance proofs  
- lineage references  
- safety classification  

No proof → no execution.

---

### **2.6 Safety Dominates Execution**
If any step presents danger, ambiguity, or uncertainty:
- execution halts  
- Architect rejects  
- MAIAi explains  
- ADT must clarify or resubmit  

Safety is the substrate’s highest law (L50).

---

### **2.7 Execution Cannot Access SVS**
Execution logic MUST NOT:
- read  
- write  
- decrypt  
- infer  

any content inside Secure Virtual Space (L02).

Execution operates on proofs, never private data.

---

## 3. Canonical Execution Flow (Unified Law)

Every execution MUST follow this exact sequence:

1. **Intent Origination** — Human → L48  
2. **ADT Structuring** — L06  
3. **Semantic Verification** — L03  
4. **Constraint Enforcement** — L31  
5. **Authority & Delegation Validation** — L21–L22, L30  
6. **Architect Evaluation** — L04  
7. **Deterministic Execution** — L05  
8. **Canonical State Update** — L07  
9. **Sealing & Finalization** — L51  
10. **Routing & Propagation** — L08  
11. **Recovery Anchoring** — L38  

Any deviation violates the Unified Execution Law.

---

## 4. What Execution Is NOT Allowed To Do

Execution MUST NOT:

- bypass identity  
- bypass ADT  
- infer or synthesize intent  
- override constraints  
- execute nondeterministically  
- access or leak private data  
- alter sealed truth  
- skip semantic verification  
- ignore domain invariants  
- escalate authority  
- permit AI-origin transitions  

Execution MUST always be intentional, constrained, authenticated, and deterministic.

---

## 5. Execution Invariants (Always True)

1. No execution without identity  
2. No execution without proof  
3. No execution without deterministic evaluation  
4. No execution without semantic correctness  
5. No execution may violate constraints  
6. No execution may alter sealed truth  
7. No execution may compromise safety  

Violation of any invariant requires immediate halt.

---

## 6. Execution Error Model

Execution errors MUST be:

- deterministic  
- reproducible  
- sealed as non-mutating failure events  
- explainable  
- attributable  
- recoverable  

Execution errors MUST never partially mutate state.

---

## 7. Cross-Domain Execution Law

When execution spans domains:

- all domain invariants MUST align  
- semantics MUST remain coherent  
- constraint sets MUST co-validate  
- lineage MUST remain unified  
- sealing MUST require multi-domain attestation  

If any domain disagrees, execution MUST fail.  
No domain may privately mutate truth.

---

## 8. Relationship to Other Layers

- **L01 Identity** — execution is identity-anchored  
- **L02 SVS** — execution never accesses private data  
- **L03 MAIAi** — semantics validated prior to execution  
- **L04 Architect** — evaluates execution legality and order  
- **L05 Execution** — applies deterministic state mutation  
- **L06 ADT** — submits user-origin execution requests  
- **L07 Canonical State** — records execution results  
- **L08 Routing** — propagates sealed truth  
- **L31 Constraints** — hard execution boundary  
- **L50 Safety** — supersedes all other concerns  
- **L51 Sealing** — execution becomes truth only when sealed  

L10 binds all layers into a single unified law.

---

## 9. Real-World Capability Enabled by the Unified Execution Law

The Unified Execution Law enables **lawful automation at civilizational scale**.

It allows:
- Governments to deploy digital systems where policy is enforced at execution, not interpretation.
- Enterprises to automate regulated workflows without legal ambiguity or manual oversight.
- AI-assisted systems to operate safely without ever acquiring authority.
- Cross-border and cross-domain systems to coordinate without treaties, trust agreements, or reconciliation layers.
- Auditors, courts, and regulators to evaluate outcomes by inspecting law-bound execution rather than intent or explanation.

L10 transforms software from **instruction-following systems**  
into **law-governed execution environments**.

---

## 10. Outcomes of the Unified Execution Law

- global determinism  
- substrate-wide safety  
- unambiguous state evolution  
- incorruptible lineage  
- provable accountability  
- interoperable domains without leakage  
- zero ambiguity in execution semantics  
- irreversible sealing of truth  
- complete prevention of unauthorized or unintended execution  

L10 establishes the Sovereign Substrate as a **constitutionally governed computational system**.
