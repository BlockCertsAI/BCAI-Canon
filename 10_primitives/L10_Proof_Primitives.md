## L10 — Sovereign Substrate Root Canon (Unified Execution Law)

The Sovereign Substrate Root Canon defines the **Unified Execution Law**:  
the non-negotiable, substrate-wide rules that govern how all computation, transitions, validation, semantics, and state change MUST occur.

L10 answers the question:  
**“What laws govern execution across the entire substrate — above domains, agents, AI, and all other layers?”**

L10 is the constitutional rulebook for execution.  
If any layer conflicts with L10, **L10 prevails.**

---

# 1. Purpose of the Unified Execution Law

The Unified Execution Law ensures:

- deterministic computation  
- authenticated participation  
- constraint-first behavior  
- semantic coherence  
- causal ordering  
- safety dominance  
- transparent and irreversible history  
- universal consistency across nodes and domains  

L10 makes the substrate **governable, predictable, and incorruptible**.

# 2. Core Tenets of the Root Execution Canon

### **2.1 Identity is Mandatory for Execution**
No operation may execute without:
- genesis identity (L01)  
- ADT mediation (L06)  
- intent validation (L48)  

Anonymous or implicit execution is prohibited.

---

### **2.2 Rules Override All Agents**
All actions MUST obey:
- constraints (L31)  
- invariants (L28)  
- domain rules  
- safety (L50)  
- identity and authority laws (L21–22)  

Nothing — not ADT, not domain logic, not MAIAi — may override these rules.

---

### **2.3 Execution is Deterministic**
Given identical conditions, all nodes MUST reach identical results:
- same state mutation  
- same lineage position  
- same sealing outcome  
- same error classifications  

Execution MUST produce reproducible outcomes globally.

---

### **2.4 Substrate Truth is Forward-Only**
Execution MUST NOT:
- mutate sealed history  
- roll back state  
- reinterpret past semantics  
- rewrite lineage  

Truth moves only forward.

---

### **2.5 Execution Requires Complete Proof**
Every action MUST carry:
- identity proof  
- authority proof  
- delegation context  
- semantic binding  
- constraint compliance proofs  
- lineage references  
- safety classification  

No proof → no execution.

---

### **2.6 Safety Dominates Execution**
If any step presents danger, ambiguity, or uncertainty:
- execution halts immediately  
- Architect rejects  
- MAIAi explains  
- ADT must resubmit or clarify  

Safety is the substrate’s highest law (L50).

---

### **2.7 Execution Cannot Access SVS**
Execution logic MAY NOT:
- read  
- write  
- decrypt  
- infer  

any content inside the Secure Virtual Space (L02).

Execution works with proofs, never private data.

---

# 3. Canonical Execution Flow (Unified Law)

Every execution MUST follow this exact sequence:

1. **Intent Origination (Human → L48)**  
2. **ADT Structuring (L06)**  
3. **Semantic Verification (L03)**  
4. **Constraint Enforcement (L31)**  
5. **Authority/Delegation Validation (L21–22, L30)**  
6. **Architect Evaluation (L04)**  
7. **Deterministic State Mutation (L07)**  
8. **Sealing and Finalization (L51)**  
9. **Routing and Propagation (L08)**  
10. **Recovery Anchoring (L38)**  

Any deviation violates the Unified Execution Law.

---

# 4. What Execution Is NOT Allowed To Do

Execution MUST NOT:

- bypass identity  
- bypass ADT  
- infer or synthesize intent  
- override constraints  
- execute nondeterministically  
- leak private data  
- alter sealed truth  
- skip semantic verification  
- ignore domain invariants  
- escalate authority  
- permit AI-origin transitions  

Execution MUST always be intentional, constrained, authenticated, and deterministic.

---

# 5. Execution Invariants (MUST Always Be True)

### **Invariant 1: No execution without identity.**  
### **Invariant 2: No execution without proof.**  
### **Invariant 3: No execution without deterministic evaluation.**  
### **Invariant 4: No execution without semantic correctness.**  
### **Invariant 5: No execution may violate constraints.**  
### **Invariant 6: No execution may alter sealed truth.**  
### **Invariant 7: No execution may compromise safety.**  

If ANY invariant is violated, execution MUST halt.

---

# 6. Execution Error Model

Execution errors must be:

- deterministic  
- reproducible  
- sealed as failure events (non-mutating)  
- explainable  
- attributable  
- recoverable  

Execution errors MUST never partially mutate state.

---

# 7. Cross-Domain Execution Law

When execution spans domains:

- all domain invariants MUST align  
- semantics MUST be coherent across domains  
- constraint sets MUST co-validate  
- lineage MUST remain unified  
- sealing MUST require multi-domain attestation  

If domains disagree → execution MUST fail.

No domain may privately mutate truth.

---

# 8. Relationship to Other Layers

### **L01 Identity** → execution must be identity-anchored  
### **L02 SVS** → execution cannot access private content  
### **L03 MAIAi** → semantics validated before execution  
### **L04 Architect** → executes law mechanically  
### **L06 ADT** → submits user-origin execution requests  
### **L07 Canonical State** → execution mutates state  
### **L08 Routing** → execution results propagate  
### **L31 Constraints** → ultimate execution gatekeeper  
### **L50 Safety** → supersedes all other execution concerns  
### **L51 Sealing** → execution becomes truth only when sealed  

L10 binds all these layers into a single unified law.

---

# 9. Outcomes of the Unified Execution Law

- global determinism  
- substrate-wide safety  
- unambiguous state evolution  
- incorruptible lineage  
- provable accountability  
- domain interoperability without leakage  
- zero ambiguity in execution semantics  
- irreversible sealing of truth  
- complete prevention of unauthorized or unintended execution  

L10 transforms the Sovereign Substrate into a **law-governed computational environment** where correctness is inevitable and error is containable.
