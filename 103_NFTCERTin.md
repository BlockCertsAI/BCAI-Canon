# NFTCERTin — Authenticated Credential & Asset Execution Layer

## Canon Classification
- **Layer Type:** Execution
- **Sovereignty Impact:** None
- **Law Interaction:** Must satisfy all existing Law and state validity constraints
- **Change Tolerance:** May evolve without redefining valid state space

## Definition

NFTCERTin is the execution-layer mechanism that issues, manages, and enforces
**identity-anchored, verifiable NFT credentials** on the authenticated internet.

NFTCERTin transforms NFTs from speculative collectibles into **authenticated certificates**
representing real assets, rights, records, and permissions.

## Core Properties

- NFTCERTin operates **only after identity verification** via Proof of Authentication (PoA).
- NFTCERTs are always bound to:
  - A verified identity
  - A verified issuing authority
  - A canonical state reference

NFTCERTin does **not** define new state validity rules.
It executes within the existing sovereign boundary.

## What NFTCERTin Executes

- Minting authenticated NFTs only for verified identities
- Binding NFTs to real-world rights and assets:
  - Property titles
  - Licenses
  - Credentials
  - Tickets
  - Contracts
  - Consents
  - Training records
  - Warranties
- Enforcing programmable access rights:
  - Portal access
  - Data access
  - Signing authority
  - Event participation
  - Service eligibility

## What NFTCERTin Does NOT Do

- Does not alter safety invariants
- Does not redefine valid states
- Does not bypass authorization Law
- Does not grant execution authority outside canonical constraints

## Execution Semantics

NFTCERTin executes **policy-level logic** such as:

- Conditional access based on NFT possession
- Revocation or expiration handling
- Rights delegation within allowed bounds
- Interoperability with external systems via authenticated gateways

All execution outcomes are validated against Law **before state mutation**.

## Canonical Purpose

NFTCERTin provides the **credential and asset execution layer** for Web4,
where trust derives from authenticated identity rather than platforms or speculation.

NFTCERTin is **execution**, not constitution.
