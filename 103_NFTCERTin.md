# NFTCERTin — Authenticated NFT Credential Execution Layer

## Canonical Classification
**Layer Type:** Execution  
**Depends On:**  
- Genesis Identity (KYC at root)  
- Proof of Authentication (PoA)  
- DomainCERTin (sovereign domain anchoring)

NFTCERTin does **not** define new safety invariants.  
It operates entirely **within Law**, executing credential logic that is only possible because identity, authorization, and state validity are already guaranteed upstream.

---

## Definition

**NFTCERTin** is the authenticated NFT execution layer of BlockCertsAI.

It transforms NFTs from speculative, bearer-based assets into **identity-anchored, programmable credentials** tied to real people, real entities, and real rights — issued only on a chain where identity is verified at the root.

NFTCERTin NFTs are not trust substitutes.  
They are **trust expressions**.

## What NFTCERTin Does (Execution Semantics)

NFTCERTin executes credential logic for NFTs that already satisfy all canonical Law requirements.

### 1. Identity-Anchored Minting
- Every NFTCERT is minted **only after KYC** via Proof of Authentication.
- No anonymous or bearer minting.
- Identity binding is enforced **before execution**, not retroactively.

### 2. Real-World Asset & Rights Representation
NFTCERTin executes NFTs representing:
- Property titles
- Licenses and permits
- Contracts and consents
- Event tickets
- Training and certification records
- Warranties and attestations

These NFTs represent **verifiable rights**, not speculative claims.

### 3. Programmable Access Control
NFTCERTin executes logic that allows NFTs to:
- Grant or deny portal access
- Unlock data or records
- Authorize document signing
- Permit event participation
- Gate enterprise or healthcare systems

All access decisions are evaluated **during execution**, using authenticated identity as input.
No passwords.
No shared secrets.
No heuristics.

## What NFTCERTin Is Not

- Not a new Law layer  
- Not a governance mechanism  
- Not a bearer-asset system  
- Not a speculative marketplace primitive  

NFTCERTin **cannot**:
- Override authorization Law
- Redefine ownership validity
- Permit anonymous control
- Create new valid state classes

---

## Why NFTCERTin Exists

Web2 trust depends on platforms.  
Web3 trust depends on code.  
**Web4 trust depends on identity.**

NFTCERTin is the credential execution layer that makes identity-based trust programmable at scale.

Because ownership is authenticated at the source:
- Impersonation is eliminated
- Forgery is impossible
- Spoofing is prevented
- Unauthorized access is rejected deterministically

## Canonical Role Summary

| Aspect | Classification |
|------|----------------|
| Identity verification | Upstream (Law) |
| State validity | Upstream (Law) |
| Authorization | Upstream (Law) |
| Credential behavior | **Execution (NFTCERTin)** |
| Access logic | **Execution (NFTCERTin)** |
| Asset semantics | **Execution (NFTCERTin)** |

## Canonical Statement

> NFTCERTin is the execution layer for authenticated, programmable credentials.  
> It expresses trust — it does not create it.

Law makes NFTCERTin possible.  
NFTCERTin makes Law useful.
