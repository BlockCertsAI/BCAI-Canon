# BCERT Wallet — Sovereign Identity & Execution Interface

## Canon Classification
- **Layer Type:** Execution Interface
- **Sovereignty Impact:** None
- **Law Interaction:** Subject to all Law and state validity constraints
- **Change Tolerance:** May evolve without redefining protocol validity

## Definition

The BCERT Wallet is the **user-facing execution interface** for interacting with the
authenticated internet.

It is not a traditional crypto wallet.
It is the **entry point into sovereign identity, user-owned data, and authenticated execution**.

## Core Components

### Identity Vault
- Genesis-block KYC verified identity
- Single identity root across all applications
- Eliminates bots, impersonation, phishing, and fake users

### Secure Virtual Space (SVS)
- Encrypted, user-owned cloud
- File storage
- Document signing
- Record management
- Permission control
- App execution environment

### Utility Execution
- Swap BCERT and INK
- Stake tokens
- Pay for services via micro-metered transactions
- No gas fees
- No miners
- No intermediaries

### Multi-Context Workspaces
- Personal
- Business
- Family
- Creative
- Each isolated under authenticated control

## What the BCERT Wallet Executes

- User-authorized actions
- Identity-based authentication
- Secure access to applications
- Transaction signing
- Permission delegation
- Cross-ecosystem connectivity via authenticated gateways

## What the BCERT Wallet Does NOT Do

- Does not define protocol Law
- Does not alter safety invariants
- Does not override authorization constraints
- Does not validate state independently

## Execution Boundary

All wallet actions:
- Are proposals, not authority
- Are validated by Law before execution
- Can be rejected deterministically

The wallet cannot force a state transition.

## Canonical Purpose

The BCERT Wallet is the **sovereign cockpit**, not the rules engine.

It gives users control without granting them authority over Law.

Identity is verified.
Data is owned.
Execution is authenticated.
Sovereignty remains intact.
