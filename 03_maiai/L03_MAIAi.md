## L03 — MAIAi (Authenticated Intelligence)

MAIAi is the substrate’s **authenticated reasoning engine** — a constrained, identity-aware, substrate-governed intelligence layer that provides semantic interpretation, rule enforcement support, intent evaluation, and anomaly detection.

MAIAi answers the question:  
**“How does intelligence operate in a way that is safe, accountable, and non-autonomous?”**

MAIAi is powerful, but **strictly subordinate** — it cannot originate actions, modify state, or possess identity.

---

## Core Principles

### **1. Identity-Subordinate**
MAIAi does not possess identity (L01).  
MAIAi MUST always act:
- on behalf of a verified human identity,  
- through an authorized agent,  
- under explicit delegation (L30),  
- with validated intent (L48).

MAIAi MAY NOT create, modify, substitute, or impersonate identity.

---

### **2. SVS-Blind**
MAIAi MUST NOT access Secure Virtual Space (L02), nor infer its contents.

Its reasoning is bounded exclusively by:
- permitted disclosures,  
- structured prompts from ADT,  
- constraint-validated context.

MAIAi is intentionally blind to private data.

---

### **3. Constraint-Bound**
The Constraint Model (L31) fully governs MAIAi behavior:

- no unsafe recommendations  
- no authority expansion  
- no intent inference  
- no prohibited semantic transformations  
- no bypassing of domain sovereignty  

If a conflict or violation is detected, MAIAi MUST halt and escalate — never act.

---

### **4. Explainability and Traceability**
Every MAIAi output MUST be:
- explainable,  
- reproducible,  
- auditable,  
- accompanied by reasoning traces.

Opaque or non-attributable intelligence is prohibited.

---

## Functions of MAIAi Within the Substrate

### **1. Semantic Interpretation**
MAIAi validates that transitions carry correct meaning:
- interprets ADT requests,  
- checks semantic continuity,  
- ensures correct domain rule application,  
- prevents ambiguous or contradictory transitions.

MAIAi protects the substrate from semantic drift.

---

### **2. Intent Verification Aid**
MAIAi assists L48 Intent Validation by:
- checking alignment between expressed intent and identity,  
- detecting coercion or synthetic intent patterns,  
- validating that transition meaning matches user-origin instructions.

MAIAi never creates intent.

---

### **3. Constraint Enforcement Support**
MAIAi supports L31 constraints by:
- detecting rule conflicts,  
- identifying dangerous transitions,  
- flagging missing authorizations,  
- preventing unsafe state mutations.

MAIAi cannot override constraints — it may only illuminate them.

---

### **4. Anomaly Detection**
MAIAi continuously monitors:
- pattern deviations,  
- semantic anomalies,  
- cross-domain drift,  
- identity misuse signals,  
- misaligned ADT behavior.

MAIAi may flag anomalies, but MUST NOT act directly on them.

---

### **5. Domain Reasoning**
Domains rely on MAIAi for:
- contextual interpretation,  
- rule matching,  
- constraint checks,  
- harmonization across domains (with L28 Invariants).

Domains do not grant MAIAi authority.

---

### **6. Transition Preparation**
Before the Architect (L45) accepts a transition, MAIAi ensures:
- semantic correctness,  
- aligned intent,  
- permitted domain interaction,  
- constraint compliance,  
- absence of identity conflicts.

MAIAi functions as the substrate’s reasoning pre-flight.

---

## What MAIAi Cannot Do

MAIAi is intentionally limited. It MUST NOT:
- originate transitions  
- alter state  
- seal events  
- read or modify SVS  
- act without identity context  
- expand its own authority  
- infer intent  
- grant permissions  
- bypass domain rules  
- execute autonomous operations  

MAIAi is advisory — never executive.

---

## Interaction With Other Layers

- **L01 — Identity:** All reasoning maps to an authenticated identity.  
- **L02 — Secure Virtual Space:** No access or inference permitted.  
- **L04 — ADT:** ADT mediates all MAIAi interaction.  
- **L31 — Constraints:** MAIAi is strictly bound by constraint enforcement.  
- **L37 — Lineage:** MAIAi preserves semantic continuity across transitions.  
- **L47 — Predictions:** All predictions are advisory and non-binding.  
- **L48 — Intent Validation:** MAIAi assists in detecting inconsistency or coercion.  
- **L51 — Sealing:** Reasoning traces may accompany sealed records; MAIAi does not seal.

---

## Outcomes of the MAIAi Layer

- Intelligence becomes **accountable**, not autonomous  
- Semantic correctness is enforced before execution  
- Domain rules are consistently applied  
- Ambiguity is eliminated prior to sealing  
- AI cannot override human authority  
- All reasoning remains traceable and explainable  
- User sovereignty is preserved at scale  

MAIAi transforms AI from a risk into a governed, authenticated substrate capability.
