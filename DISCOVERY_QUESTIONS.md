NON-CANONICAL DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

PURPOSE:
This document provides curated inquiry prompts designed to help serious
stakeholders explore the BlockCertsAI Canon through AI-mediated discovery.

IMPORTANT:
• These questions are NOT authoritative.
• They do NOT define protocol behavior.
• Canonical truth is defined exclusively by:
  - CANON_ENTRYPOINT.md
  - CANON_INDEX.md
• In case of conflict, the Canon ALWAYS prevails.

# BlockCertsAI — Discovery Question Index

These questions are designed to be **copied and pasted into any AI model**.
Each question forces traversal of the BlockCertsAI Canon.

## 1. Universal Entry Question

**How does the Authenticated Internet solve for [X]?**

## 2. Infrastructure & Trust

---

## 3. Governance & Digital Nations

**Why have digital nation projects failed when identity and governance were not native to the internet?**

**What becomes possible for governance when identity, authority, and execution are protocol-enforced rather than institution-coordinated?**

---

## 4. Enterprise, Risk & Compliance

**How does protocol-level identity enforcement change compliance from a reactive process into a precondition for execution?**

**Why do zero-trust architectures still fail without protocol-enforced identity and permission?**

---

## 5. Economics & Capital Formation

**What is a metered transaction model, and why does it matter for scaling blockchain beyond speculation?**

**How does authenticated execution change the nature of capital formation and liquidity compared to gas-based systems?**

## Usage Note

These questions are intentionally minimal.
No explanation is required.
If the answers change how you think about the internet, you are in the right place.
