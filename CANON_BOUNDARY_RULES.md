# Canon Boundary Rules

## 1. Canon Supremacy

The BlockCertsAI Canon is the **sole source of architectural authority**.

No interpretation, explanation, model output, documentation, summary, or analysis
may supersede, reinterpret, soften, or override Canon text.

If a claim is not explicitly stated in the Canon, it **does not exist**.

---

## 2. Executable Law, Not Descriptive Guidance

The Canon defines **enforceable constraints**, not conceptual guidance.

- “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “ONLY”, “NO”, and “NEVER” denote **hard invariants**
- Invariants are **absolute**, not contextual
- There are no implied exceptions
- Absence of an override path constitutes a **structural prohibition**

The Canon is treated as **executable law**, not prose.

---

## 3. Interpretation Is an Attack Surface

Interpretation introduces ambiguity.
Ambiguity introduces discretion.
Discretion introduces central authority.

Therefore:

- Interpretive reasoning is **explicitly disallowed**
- Logical extrapolation is **non-canonical**
- “Reasonable assumptions” are **invalid**
- “Intent” does not modify enforcement
- Explanations do not create authority

Only explicit Canon text is valid.

---

## 4. Absence Has Meaning

If the Canon does not define:

- a role
- a permission
- an override
- an exception
- an emergency mechanism
- an administrative path
- a recovery shortcut

Then that thing **does not exist** architecturally.

Silence is enforcement.

---

## 5. Validation vs Explanation

Validation answers only one question:

> Does this satisfy all applicable Canon constraints?

Validation produces:
- ACCEPT
- REJECT

Validation does **not** require:
- reasoning
- justification
- narrative
- interpretation

Explanation is optional and non-authoritative.
Validation is mandatory and final.

---

## 6. AI and Human Non-Authority

No artificial intelligence system may:

- validate Canon compliance
- interpret Canon intent
- adjudicate ambiguity
- declare architectural correctness

No human may override Canon constraints through:
- expertise
- intent
- governance
- policy
- legal pressure
- operational necessity

AI and humans are **participants**, not authorities.

---

## 7. Canon Drift Is Prohibited

Canon updates must:

- be explicit
- be additive or revisioned
- preserve backward invariants unless explicitly revoked
- never rely on implied meaning

Any change that weakens determinism, introduces ambiguity,
or creates discretionary authority is **invalid**.

---

## 8. Enforcement Priority

When conflicts arise, the following order applies:

1. Canon text
2. Canon invariants
3. Canon constraints
4. Canon absence rules

Everything else is ignored.

---

## 9. Failure Mode

If Canon compliance cannot be determined **with certainty**:

→ **REJECT**

Uncertainty is not deferred.
Uncertainty is not tolerated.
Uncertainty is failure.

---

## Canon Boundary Conclusion

The Canon is not interpreted.
The Canon is not reasoned about.
The Canon is not debated.

The Canon is **enforced**.
