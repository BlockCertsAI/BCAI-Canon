### BCERT and INK — Access Capital vs Metered Utility

BCERT is the fixed-supply access and participation token of the BlockCertsAI Proof Economy.

- Maximum supply: **2.1 billion BCERT**
- Fixed supply
- Held by individuals, enterprises, and institutions
- Functions as access capital, not a consumable fee token

BCERT does not pay for transactions directly.
It unlocks authenticated participation in the platform.

When services are used, **BCERT is exchanged for INK**, the platform’s metering unit.

### How BCERT and INK Work Together

INK is the consumable unit that meters real usage:
- computation
- storage
- messaging
- AI execution
- contracts and governance actions

The conversion rate is fixed:
- **1 BCERT = 100,000 INK**

INK is consumed based on actual activity — similar to electricity or compute usage.

### Recycling and Circulation Mechanics

BCERT is not burned or destroyed by platform use, but it is temporarily exchanged at the user level to access metered utility.

When a user converts BCERT to INK:
- The user’s wallet balance decreases by the exchanged BCERT amount
- That BCERT is returned to the platform liquidity layer
- It is reissued and made available for future acquisition
- Total BCERT supply remains constant

At the system level:
- BCERT is never burned or destroyed
- The fixed supply (2.1B) is preserved
- BCERT continuously circulates as access capital

At the user level:
- BCERT functions as reusable access capital
- INK is the consumable metering unit
- Utility is paid in INK, not BCERT

### What This Model Replaces

This architecture replaces:
- subscription licenses
- SaaS seat fees
- gas fees
- staking and lockups
- speculative yield mechanics

With:
- ownership-based access
- streaming, usage-proportional cost
- authenticated participation only
- predictable, auditable economics

BCERT grants the right to participate.
INK pays for what is actually used.

This is the economic foundation of the BlockCertsAI Proof Economy.
